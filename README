NAME
    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple - A simple single-sheet Excel document

SYNOPSIS
      my $ss = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple->new;
         $ss->write_bold_row(\@headings);
         $ss->write_row(\@data);

      print $ss->data;
            # or
            $ss->save("filename.xls");

DESCRIPTION
    This provides an abstraction to the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module for
    easier creation of simple single-sheet Excel documents.

    In its most basic form it provides two methods for writing data:
    write_row and write_bold_row which write the data supplied to the next
    row of the spreadsheet.

    However, you can also use $ss->book and $ss->sheet to get at the
    underlying workbook and worksheet from Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you
    wish to manipulate these directly.

METHODS
  new
      my $ss = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple->new;

    Create a new single-sheet Excel document. You should not supply this a
    filename or filehandle. The data is stored internally, and can be
    retrieved later through the 'data' method or saved using the 'save'
    method.

  write_row / write_bold_row
      $ss->write_bold_row(\@headings);
      $ss->write_row(\@data);

    These write the list of data into the next row of the spreadsheet.

    Caveat: An internal counter is kept as to which row is being written to,
    so if you mix these functions with direct writes of your own, these
    functions will continue where they left off, not where you have written
    to.

  data
      print $ss->data;

    This returns the data of the spreadsheet. If you're planning to print
    this to a web-browser, be sure to print an 'application/excel' header
    first.

  book / sheet
      my $workbook  = $ss->book;
      my $worksheet = $ss->sheet;

    These return the underlying Spreadsheet::WriteExcel objects representing
    the workbook and worksheet respectively. If you find yourself making
    more that a trivial amount of use of these, you probably shouldn't be
    using this module, but using Spreadsheet::WriteExcel directly.

  save
            $ss->save("filename.xls");

    Save the spreadsheet with the given filename.

BUGS
    This can't yet handle dates in a sensible manner.
